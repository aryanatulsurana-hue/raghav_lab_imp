# 🐦 Bird Song Analysis (Zebra Finch Project)

This repository contains code for real-time detection and modulation of introductory notes in zebra finch songs, combining **bioacoustic signal processing** with **machine learning**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect and classify introductory notes in real-time.
- Explore modulation patterns in song motifs.
- Integrate detection with neural feedback experiments (future scope).

## 🧰 Methods & Tools
- **Python**, **TensorFlow**, **Librosa**, **SoundDevice**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**
- Audio feature extraction (mel spectrograms)
- Neural network-based real-time classifier
- Configurable thresholds and latency optimization
